            <h3>The short history of Mona</h3>
            
            <p>Monaâ€™s previous owner was a young boy who had gotten Mona as a pet, but after she bit him, he had become scared of her. After that, Mona was pretty much left to herself in her cage, rarely getting out to explore, or getting handled as a pet. Because of this, she never really got tame.</p>
            
            <p>When we got Mona, we could not even touch her without her squealing at us or biting our fingers.</p>
            
            <p>Slowly, we started to gain her trust, and after weeks of hand-feeding her delicious snacks and letting her sniff our fingers, we could start to pet and touch her.</p>
            
            <p>A few months before her death, she had gotten so used to us, that we could hold her and play with her, (almost!) without getting bit. But she never got entirely tame, and that is just fine. She was a great hamster and an excellent companion, nonetheless.</p>
            
            <p>Mona died on February 23rd, 2021.</p>
